# Beginner_Animation

Hey Everyone! Shalini this side...

It is a simple project made by me with the guidance of Code with Harry!
This project is an interactive animation that incorporates various elements to create an engaging experience. 
When a button is clicked, the animations are triggered, including moving elements, shaking effects, and dynamic background changes. 
Additionally, the project includes the functionality to play a sound file, enhancing the audiovisual experience.
